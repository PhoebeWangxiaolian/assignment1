# Assignment 1 </br>

[My Github profile](https://github.com/PhoebeWangxiaolian) </br> `r # Insert a link to your Github profile page`

## My Goals for HUDK4050 </br>`r # Create a second level heading that says My Goals for HUDK4050`
* My first goal for this class is to learn some new methodology for some similar problems in data mining </br>
* The second goal is to proficiency in applying machine learning </br>
* Last goal is to prepare to be professionals in the discipline </br> 
`r # "Create a bulletted list that describes three goals you have for this class"`

## Video Review </br>`r # Create another second level heading that says "Video Review"`

The video is well organized although it is short. I think the video is clearly enough. However, I was wondering whether this class would refer to machine learning? </br> `r # Add a review of the class videos you have seen so far, write a sentence or two about what you would change and what you would keep`

|  Skill |  Score |
| :---: | :----: | 
| Data Structure| 5 | 
| The video is well organized | The intro music is not really my style| </br>

`r # Create a table with two columns and three rows. In the header (first row) of the first column put the word "Skill", in the header of the second column put the word "Score". In the second row of the first column put a word that describes a skill you want to improve at, and in the second row of the second column put a score out of 10 that describes your current level of that skill. In the remaining two cells write your opinion of the class videos you have seen so far.`

## This is how I am feeling about the semester `r # Create another second level heading that says "This is how I am feeling about the semester"`

Ok, just joking!

`r # Find an image of a piece of art that sums up how you are feeling about the semester ahead, upload it to the repository (add it to the folder where your project is located) and then insert it into the document`
